I'm a master's student currently pursing my MSc. in Computer Science from Université Grenoble Alpes in Grenoble, France. I recently completed my first year of master's M1 and would be pursuing M2 starting from September 2020 with specialization Artificial Intelligence and the Web (AIW).

My main fields of interests are Singla Processing, Embededd Systems and AI.
